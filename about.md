About Me
I am a Quantitative Researcher at the Climate Corporation. My research interests include machine learning, data mining and optimization algorithms. You can find my publications in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kHeI720AAAAJ&hl=en) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ye-chen/56/9b8/606).

Besides research, I like programming a lot during the past 10+ years. I programmed using Basic/Visual Basic, Pascal/Delphi, C/C++, assembly language (for both x86 and MCU), VHDL, Verilog, Matlab, and most recently, R. However, I am not an expert in any of them :(.
