ACOR is an ant colony optimization for continuous domain functions. It was proposed by K. Socha in 2008. And an implement in `R` is available. I re-implemented ACOR in C++ in order to optimize the parameters for a graphical model called fuzzy cognitive maps. The ACOR part is extracted form the that project and uploaded to the acor-cpp GitHub repo, in order to make it accessible to more users of different backgrounds.

Project in progress...
