title:  "ACS4Fun: An Ant Colony System for General Function Optimization"

This is a C++ code that was developed to find the solution(s) that minimize any given general function of real variables. It was first developed in 2003 and a related paper was published in 2004 (in Chinese). Although it is an old code and the performance of the algorithm is not as good as the state-of-the-art algorithms, it could still be used by people with a non-optimization background to solve many function optimization problems.

The `main.cpp` contains a simple example to use the code.

{% highlight C++ %}
CACS4Fun \*acs;
acs = new CACS4Fun();
acs-\>alpha = 0.8;
#=> define
{% endhighlight %}
